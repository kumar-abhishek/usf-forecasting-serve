📊 Demand Forecasting with LightGBM: Detailed Project Report

1️⃣ Introduction

Project Goal

The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that accurately forecasts future sales for store-item combinations. Sales forecasting is crucial for businesses to optimize inventory management, reduce overstocking and understocking risks, and improve financial planning.

Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of historical daily sales data for multiple store-item combinations. It includes the following key columns:
	•	date: The transaction date.
	•	store: The store identifier.
	•	item: The item identifier.
	•	sales: The number of units sold (target variable).

Tools & Technologies Used

To build a robust and scalable solution, we leveraged:
	•	Python: Core programming language for data processing, modeling, and API development.
	•	Pandas & NumPy: Data manipulation and numerical operations.
	•	LightGBM: Gradient boosting framework for fast and efficient model training.
	•	SHAP: Explainability tool to understand feature impact.
	•	FastAPI: API framework for serving predictions in real-time.
	•	Docker: Containerization for deployment.
	•	AWS: Cloud deployment for scalability.
	•	GitHub Actions: CI/CD for automation of testing, building, and deployment.

2️⃣ Approach

📌 Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

To enhance the model’s predictive power, we performed the following preprocessing steps:

🔹 Handling Time-based Features

Since sales exhibit seasonality and trends, we extracted time-based features from the date column:
	•	month: Captures seasonal patterns (e.g., increased sales in holiday months).
	•	day: Represents the day of the week, which can influence sales trends.
	•	year: Helps capture long-term trends.

🔹 Handling Missing Values
	•	Checked for missing values and found none in the dataset.
	•	If missing values existed, we would have used imputation techniques (e.g., forward-fill or median replacement).

🔹 Encoding Categorical Variables
	•	The dataset contained categorical features (store and item) that were label-encoded, as LightGBM handles categorical variables efficiently.

🔹 Train-Test Split

To validate model performance, the dataset was split into:
	•	80% Training Data
	•	20% Validation Data
Using:

train_x, test_x, train_y, test_y = train_test_split(train_df[features], train_df[y], test_size=0.2, random_state=2018)

This ensures the model generalizes well on unseen data.

3️⃣ Model Selection & Training

📌 Why LightGBM?

We experimented with multiple models and selected LightGBM due to:
✅ Faster training speed
✅ Ability to handle large datasets efficiently
✅ Built-in handling of missing values and categorical variables

📌 Alternative Models Considered
	1.	ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
	•	Strength: Works well for single time series.
	•	Weakness: Does not handle multiple store-item time series well.
	2.	Prophet (Facebook Prophet)
	•	Strength: Strong at handling seasonal patterns.
	•	Weakness: Slower compared to gradient boosting methods.
	3.	XGBoost
	•	Strength: Another strong gradient boosting method.
	•	Weakness: Slower training time compared to LightGBM.

LightGBM was the best trade-off between speed and accuracy, making it ideal for this forecasting task.

📌 Hyperparameter Tuning

To optimize the model, we used Bayesian Optimization for hyperparameter tuning. The key parameters tuned:
	•	Learning rate: Adjusted for faster convergence.
	•	Number of leaves: Controlled model complexity.
	•	L1 & L2 regularization: Prevented overfitting.

4️⃣ Model Evaluation & Results

📌 Evaluation Metric: MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)

We used MAPE to measure how well the model forecasts sales:
￼

📌 Results Comparison

Model	MAPE Score
LightGBM (regression_l1 loss)	0.1327
LightGBM (huber loss)	0.1429

🔹 Conclusion: The regression_l1 loss function performed better than huber, achieving lower MAPE (0.1327).

5️⃣ SHAP Model Explainability

To understand how features impact predictions, we used SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations).

📊 Key Insights from SHAP Analysis

🔹 SHAP Summary Plot
	•	item is the most influential feature in sales predictions.
	•	month confirms seasonality trends.
	•	store and day also contribute, but to a lesser extent.

🔹 SHAP Bar Plot
	•	Highlights the absolute importance of each feature.
	•	Confirms that item and month dominate model decisions.

🔹 SHAP Dependence Plot
	•	Shows how month affects sales predictions.
	•	Some months exhibit higher sales impact (likely due to seasonality).

📁 SHAP plots are stored in shap_plots/ directory.
📜 Detailed SHAP insights are available in SHAP Analysis.

6️⃣ Deployment & MLOps

📌 API Deployment with FastAPI

To serve real-time predictions, we built an API using FastAPI.

API Workflow:
	1.	User sends a request:

{
  "date": "2013-01-01",
  "store": 1,
  "item": 1
}


	2.	API processes input:
	•	Extracts month, day, year features.
	•	Feeds into the trained LightGBM model.
	3.	Returns a sales forecast:

{
  "sales_prediction": 48.5
}



📌 Containerization with Docker
	•	Dockerized the API using a lightweight container.
	•	Dockerfile optimized for fast deployment.

📌 CI/CD with GitHub Actions
	•	Unit tests run on every commit.
	•	Docker image built automatically.
	•	Future improvement: Deploy model to AWS ECS (Fargate).

7️⃣ Recommendations & Next Steps

🔹 Future Improvements

✅ Use Time-Based Validation: Instead of random 80-20 splits, implement time-series cross-validation.
✅ Experiment with Deep Learning: Try LSTMs or Transformer-based forecasting for long-term prediction.
✅ Deploy to AWS ECS: Automate deployment to AWS for scalable inference.

📌 Conclusion

This project successfully built a highly accurate forecasting model, deployed it as an API, and integrated MLOps best practices. Future enhancements can further improve scalability, accuracy, and automation.
